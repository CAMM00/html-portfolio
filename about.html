<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a 16 year old kid that was born and raised in a place called Kokomo IN,
  I have always loved gaming and technology but I never thought I could afford it! Until I found out about
  Udemy now I am chasing my dreams to be a software engineer. I want to finish highschool and get my
  bachelor's degree in software engineering. I would love to eventually help other young people chase there dreams aswell!
